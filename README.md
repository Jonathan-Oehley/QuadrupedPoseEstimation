# QuadrupedPoseEstimation
Mechatronics Undergraduate Final Year Project on Improved Neural Network Architecture for Pose Estimation of Quadrupeds 

Rough Google Colaboratory Notebooks which contain the code used in my final year project. Feel free to place an issue/comment if you want to get hold of me. I am happy to answer any questions. Code is based of DeepLabCut and DeeperCut code bases. See https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut and https://pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ respectively.
